# TA Meeting Notes
## April 16, 2025, 3:00pm
### Attendees: Shelby Myraman, Yuan-Kai "Kevin" Yang

### Agenda Items
* Proper empty directory file structure for repos
  * Don't use "empty.txt", instead use an empty ".gitkeep" instead
  * More similar to industry standards
* Meeting Notes
  * Will be evaluated indirectly in terms of grad
    * It's a way to track the team's progress
  * Start using the [cse110-sp25-group25](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group25/cse110-sp25-group25/) repo to store meeting notes
    * Have them in markdown, best industry practice
  * Shelby will not be able to take Notion pages into consideration when grading
* Advice for Current Assignment
  * Common mistake for developers is not consistently pushing a few lines of code
    * When developers hoard their code, it makes the merge conflict issue at the end terrible
  * Try using the project boards feature on GitHub
    * Put issues on there, use timelines (i.e. Gantt Chart)
    * Create one project board for the warmup project
    * Create one project board for the final project
  * **Most Important Component** of this assignment is the SWOT Analysis
    * Helps team leads assess the state of the team and figure out weaknesses
      * Ex: if someone is not comfortable with HTML/CSS, we need to work with them to get them more comfortable with it
      * Ex: if someone is very adamant about using ChatGPT code that they don't fully understand, we need to have a conversation with them
* New Member
  * 12th member has not gotten back to Shelby and has missed a few assignments now
  * Unsure about their status, will be contacting by next week
