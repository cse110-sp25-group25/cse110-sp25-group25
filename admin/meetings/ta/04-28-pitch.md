### Attendees: Shelby Myraman, Evan Honggo Widjojo, Yuan-Kai "Kevin" Yang


### ✏️ Notes from Shelby
- Great work on the submission, everything looks great!
- Increased Unecessary Complexity
  - Don't use electron unless it's needed
  - API might add more complexity (constantly updating, might break the app)
  	- We'll need to write a ADR about this if we want to use it
  	- **Recommendation**: Try getting static data first (Scrape something online, finding something)
- Can be helpful for the team to know the "Must haves" and "Nice to haves" (ex. GPS)
	- Helps people not go down a unncessary rabbit hole
	- Clearly define expectations of the MVP
- Roadmap/Timeline: Don't get too stuck in the weeds, allow some flexibility
- Get started!
	- Assignments for 110 will not be very concrete
	- We will decide when deadlines are
