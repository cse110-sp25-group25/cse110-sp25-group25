### Cass

- **What was completed:** added instructions to homepage and made minor UI/UX fixes (added logo hyperlink, removed swipe arrows, polished swipe buttons, filter progress navigation, favicon and titles)
- **Any blockers faced:** still want to make more changes but busy with finals
- **Thoughts/Reflections:** it was a pleasure working with everyone :)

### Thomas

### Yilin

- **What was completed: I implemented the minimum rating filter.**
- **Any blockers faced: No**
- **Thoughts/Reflections: Thank you for all your work!**

### Harrison

- **What was completed: I finished the minimum rating filter by adding clickable stars instead of a number input for desktop and mobile. Also, did some codebase refactoring.**
- **Any blockers faced: I had trouble making the stars show up correctly instead of stacking, but ended up fixing it. Also there was a lot of code to go through for the refactoring.**
- **Thoughts/Reflections: I learned a lot about using the CSS flexbox, although the styling was frustrating at first, figuring it out was satisfying.**

- **Any blockers faced: Forgot I was supposed to merge my branch**
- **Thoughts/Reflections: hope the video comes out ok üò≠**

### Kate

- **What was completed:** I replaced the price input in the Budget filter with price range buttons, so the user now chooses between ‚Äú$‚Äù, ‚Äú$$‚Äù, and ‚Äú$$$‚Äù instead of inputting a fixed amount of dollars into their budget.
- **Any blockers faced:** I had a final on Thursday, but managed to finish my task on time.
- **Thoughts/Reflections:** As we‚Äôre approaching the coding freeze deadline, I think our app already looks really good :)

### Kalkin

- **What was completed:** Completed PR for cleaning up the Filter page ui by removing the initial screen, reviewed a lot of PRs and helped with merge conflicts
