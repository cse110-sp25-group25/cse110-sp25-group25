### 🔧 Level 1: Card Deck + Flip/Shuffle Animation

**Team Plan + Assignment Summary**

---

### 📅 **Due:** Sunday, April 20 by 11:59 PM

**Points:** 6

---

## ✅ **Assignment Overview**

Build a `<playing-card>` Web Component to explore core front-end engineering practices before the final project begins. Focus on clean code, modular design, and team collaboration using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JS** only.

You are required to complete **Level 1 only**:

> 🎯 Create a card widget with flip and/or shuffle animation
>

## 🧩 **1. Build: Card Widget (Level 1 Required)**

- Use Web Components (`<playing-card>`)
- Add flip and/or shuffle animation using **CSS 3D transforms**
- Use **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS** — no frameworks or libraries

---

## ⚙️ **2. GitHub Workflow**

- Repo name: `warmup-exercise` (inside your team org)
- Use **GitHub Issues** to divide work & track progress
- Push often with meaningful commit messages
- Final submission must be documented clearly in the repo

**📁 Recommended Folder Structure:**

```
/source
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── card.js
└── deck.js (optional)

/admin/adr
└── warmup.pdf (final PDF: SWOT + links + summary)

/README.md
```

## 🧠 **3. Learning Reflection (SWOT Analysis)**

Write a PDF with:

- Team number and team name
- GitHub repo link
- YouTube demo link (≤ 3 minutes)
- **SWOT analysis** for:
    - Team: Communication & collaboration
    - Tech: Web Components, state logic, styling
    - Tool: GitHub flow, Issues, dev setup
- Brief summary of key learnings

📍 Place the final PDF in `/admin/adr/warmup.pdf`

📤 Submit the same PDF to Gradescope
