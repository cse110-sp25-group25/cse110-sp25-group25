# 🚀 CSE110 Starting Pitch – Spring 2025

**Due:** Monday by 12 PM

**Points:** 3

**Available After:** April 22 at 10 PM

**❗ Important:** Do *not* start this until your **Brainstorming Activity** is complete.

## 📘 Overview

This assignment builds directly on your brainstorming. You’ll shape your project into a clear **pitch** that reflects:

- What you’re doing
- Why it matters
- The **risks and rabbit holes** you see ahead
- Who it’s for (personas)
- What it will look like (wireframes, system diagram)

Inspired by the book **Shape Up by Basecamp** (which you should **read or skim as a team**).

## ✅ Pitch Requirements

You’ll create either a **Slide Deck (PDF, max 16 slides)** or **Document (PDF, max 8 pages)**.

> 🔹 Diagrams (full-page system diagrams, wireframes, etc.) don’t count toward the page/slide limit.

## 🧠 Pro Tip: Questions to Think About

Use these to guide the shaping process (optional prep for the team):

1. What are we actually building, and why?
2. What’s the *core* problem we’re solving?
3. How does this fit into our available time (5–6 weeks)?
4. What’s the riskiest part of this project?
5. What’s something we could easily overbuild or overcomplicate?
6. What’s the minimum we can do and still consider it a success?
7. How do we ensure we’re building for real users and not just ourselves?
