## 💡 **Kevin’s Idea**

### 4. **Daily Affirmation Card App**

- A **digital self-care and mindfulness companion**
- Hybrid between a **collector app** and a **daily reflection tool**
- Users can pull unique affirmation cards each day, reflect on them, and build a gallery of their favorite cards, moods, and personal notes.
- **What real-world problem do you want our app to solve?**
    - People often neglect their mental wellness and self-worth in a fast-paced world. Daily affirmations are a simple but powerful tool to combat anxiety, self-doubt, and negative self-talk.
- **Why does this problem matter to you or others?**
    - Everyone could use a little more encouragement and intentional mindfulness in their day. This app can help promote self-love, positive thinking, and emotional resilience, especially during moments of stress or burnout.
- **What are the biggest pain points for users facing this problem?**
    - Most affirmation apps are too plain, repetitive, or impersonal.
    - Lack of customization or meaningful interaction.
    - Users forget to use the app consistently due to lack of engagement or reminders.
    - Many tools don’t let users reflect or *track* emotional growth over time.
- **What would a “great experience” look like for someone using our app?**
    - They wake up, open the app, and pull a card that feels inspirational.
    - They can journal a quick thought or intention for the day.
    - Over time, they look back on their gallery of saved cards and reflections, seeing how far they’ve come.
- **What’s one feature you think is absolutely essential for the app to work?**
    - **Daily Affirmation Card Pull with Animation + Save/Reflect Option**
        - Why? Card pulling, card storing, and reflection are central to the app's functionality.
- **What’s one “nice to have” feature that could make our app stand out?**
    - **“Affirmation Altar” or Mood Gallery:**
        - A space where users can pin their favorite cards, tag their moods, and even add soft music or ambient animations.
        - Becomes a digital sanctuary for the user.
        - Users can set themes (e.g., confidence, love, calm), and the deck adapts over time to their needs.
- **What kind of data do you imagine our app will need to store, process, or display?**
    - Daily card pulls + timestamps
    - User mood tags (e.g., anxious, hopeful, grateful)
    - User journal reflections (text)
    - Gallery of saved cards
    - Personalized themes/preferences
    - Optional: reminders, streaks, and engagement data
- **What kind of tone or vibe should our app have?**
    - Calm, cozy, soft
    - Gentle, encouraging, nurturing
    - Visually soothing: soft pastels, dreamy gradients, maybe subtle animations
- **Are there any apps you like the look and feel of?**
    - **Reflectly** – clean and emotion-centric journaling
    - **Lumy** – beautifully minimal with subtle animations and a calming interface
    - **Loóna** – dreamy, immersive design with interactive calming experiences
