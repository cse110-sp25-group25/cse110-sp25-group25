2. discuss about our final project assignment
3. to do 

# discuss about the weekly task

### **1. Team Group Contract (Charter)**

🗓 **Due: May 10 @ 11:59 PM**

As a team, write a **contract** covering your goals, values, roles, communication plan, and accountability rules. Save it as `rules.md` in `/admin/misc/`, and have each member sign and upload their own **PDF acknowledgment** (e.g., `rules-johndoe.pdf`). Then submit your repo link on Gradescope.

### 2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) – Checkpoint 1**

🗓 **Due: May 11 @ 11:59 PM**

Create and commit **at least 2 ADRs** documenting major technical decisions your team has made so far. Save them in `/specs/adrs/`, use date-based filenames, and submit your GitHub repo link on Gradescope **and** DM your TA.

---

### **3. CI/CD Pipeline – Phase 1**

🗓 **Due: May 11 @ 11:59 PM**

Set up a basic **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions with at least **2 features** (e.g., linting, testing). Save a Markdown write-up (`phase1.md`), a diagram (`phase1.png`), and a demo video (`phase1.mp4`) in `/admin/cipipeline/`, then submit the repo link on Gradescope and DM your TA.
