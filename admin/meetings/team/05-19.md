## 👨‍💻 **Developer Tasks**

| **Task** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Finish the Form Flow** | Save all filter inputs from user (cuisine, budget, distance). In the end, apply filters to database and show matching results. **Example:** cuisine = “Japanese” → budget = “$” → distance = “5mi” |
| **Refine Flip Function** | Currently hardcoded; only first card flips and only shows reviews. Refactor so **any card can flip** and show full info dynamically. |
| **Code Card Layout in `collections.html`** | Implement card design based on screenshot. Ensure proper styling and layout structure. |
| **Code Functional Header in `collections.html`** | Build and connect the top header (per screenshot).  |
| **Finalize `filters.html` Layout** | Code the final design. Fix layout issues. Match spacing and UX with designer specs. |
| **Update Assets Across Pages and swipe.html design** | Replace placeholder logos and images with designer-provided ones. Update `swipe.html` layout & visuals. |
| **Connect Accept/Decline to `collections.html`** | Hook up Harry & Nathan’s logic from previous week. Accepted cards should appear dynamically in the user’s “My Picks” collection. |

## 🎨 **Designer Tasks**

| **Task** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Card Click Design (Question)** | ❓ What happens when a user clicks on a card in `collections.html`? Should it expand, open modal, or flip? Provide clear design/answer. |
| **Finalize Collections Card Design** | Lock in final layout, spacing, styling. Ensure mobile/desktop compatibility. |
| **Design Finalization Discussion** | Check which pages/components are finalized. Call them “dev ready.” |
| **Handoff Assets to Devs** | Push all final assets (images, SVGs, logos) to GitHub and make a PR. Notify devs clearly. |
