# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

![Pipeline Diagram](./phase2.drawio.png)

#### Overview: In phase 1, we made a cookie-cutter CI/CD pipeline that runs unit tests, lint checks, and HTML validation. We also enforced peer review before merging to main. In phase 2, we added onto it by adding a code coverage check and automatic documentation generation using JSDoc. We plan to add E2E testing and code quality checks.

## 1. What‚Äôs Working Today¬†

| Stage | Job ID | Purpose | Triggers | Outcome when **passing** |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Unit Tests** | `tests` | Runs Jest against `./__tests__/dummy-test.js` (and any other tests we add). | `push`, `pull_request` | Green check‚Äëmark; fails workflow for failed Jest tests. |
| **Linting** | `lint` | Executes `npx eslint ./` after installing dependencies. | `push`, `pull_request` | Annotations on PRs for every lint error or warning + fails the workflow on errors. |
| **Markup & CSS Validation** | `validate-html` | Uses **Nu‚ÄØHTML‚ÄØChecker** (via `Cyb3r‚ÄëJak3/html5validator-action@v7.2.0`) to scan all `*.html` (and `.r.html`) files. | `push`, `pull_request` | Fails the workflow on invalid HTML/CSS. |
| **Require merge / code‚Äëowner reviewers** | `review` | Enforce peer review before merging to `main`. | `pull_request` | Doesn't allow merge until approval |
| **Code Coverage** | `coverage` | Has the Github Actions bot automatically report code coverage on each PR as a comment | `pull_request` | Gives extra information for reviewers to look at before approving or requesting changes |
| **JSDoc Generation** | `jsdoc` | Automatically generates a page for documentation of js functions and deploys it to github pages | `push` to `main` | The Github Actions bot automatically creates generates styled html code for every function that has documentation, and then creates a PR to deploy this code to main |

## 2. Planned Next¬†

| Idea | Target Release | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| E2E Testing | Before final submission | It's really helpful to have and a great way to quickly check that we haven't broken anything |
| Code quality checks | Before final submission | It could be helpful to see how each PR impacts code quality, giving the reviewer more insight before approving it |
