# ADR: Choose Figma for Frontend UI Design

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-05-09 

## Context

Our team needs a design tool that supports efficient frontend UI creation and integrates well with our development workflows. We evaluated Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD as potential solutions.

## Decision

We chose **Figma** as our primary design tool for frontend UI work.

Figma stood out because:
- It is cloud-based and platform-independent.
- It supports real-time collaboration, improving team alignment.
- It allows direct developer inspection of design specs and code snippets.
- It integrates with tools in our workflow (e.g. Miro, Slack).
- It supports scalable design systems via components and shared libraries.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Designers and developers can work together more seamlessly.
- Easy sharing with stakeholders through a single URL.
- Reduced friction in handoff and feedback loops.
- Better version control and design consistency.

### Negative:
- Some onboarding/training needed for those new to Figma.
- Time and effort required to migrate assets from other tools.

Overall, adopting Figma aligns with our goals for speed, collaboration, and design consistency across frontend development.
