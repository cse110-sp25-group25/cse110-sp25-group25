# Choosing Local Storage

## Context and Problem Statement

When our user swipes and selects restaurants, we need a way to persist the user's preferences and choices locally so that the app can remember them on future visits without requiring a login or constant backend communication.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Need for quick, low-latency access to user preferences  
* Minimize backend dependencies
* Persistent data storage across user sessions in the same browser  
* Offline support for user actions like swiping and liking restaurant

## Considered Options

* Local Storage
* Firebase
* MongoDB


## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Local Storage"**, because it offers the simplest and fastest way to persist user state on the client side with no backend setup required. It directly supports our minimal backend, browser-based storage of swipe preferences without external network calls.

### Consequences

* Good, because it allows instant read/write operations with no network latency  
* Good, because it keeps MVP architecture simple and frontend-only  
* Bad, because data is not shareable across devices or browsers  
* Bad, because it has a storage limit and is vulnerable to being cleared by users

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Local Storage

* Good, because it is supported by all modern browsers  
* Good, because it requires no backend configuration  
* Neutral, because it only works per device/browser  
* Bad, because data is not encrypted or secure  
* Bad, because it has a size limitation and is easily cleared  

### Firebase

* Good, because it supports real-time syncing across devices  
* Good, because it includes built-in authentication if needed later  
* Neutral, because it adds complexity to frontend-only MVP  
* Bad, because it introduces external dependencies and setup time  
* Bad, because it requires managing quotas, rules, and billing  

### MongoDB

* Good, because it allows flexible schema and scaling for large apps  
* Good, because it supports advanced querying and relations  
* Neutral, because it requires building out a backend API  
* Bad, because it's overkill for a simple MVP and adds significant setup time  
* Bad, because user preferences need additional backend logic for syncing and security
