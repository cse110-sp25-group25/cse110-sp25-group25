# Choosing Github Pages for Deployment

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a host to deploy our website so people can interact with the application we have created. The host must serve our needs for the purposes of this class, without adding unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for a reliable host that can deploy our web app when we need it
* Need for a simple host that will not be complex to set up
* Preference for a free host, since the site is for class

## Considered Options

* Github Pages
* Electron

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Github Pages"**, because we have been accustomed to it through the labs, and it minimizes the amount of tools used.

### Consequences

* Good, because it is a simple and reliable way to deploy our page.
* Good, because we are already familiarized, so there will be no learning curve to using it.
* Good, because it is in the same place as other Github tools, so it minimizes complexity.
* Bad, because we may not be able to expand our app with more complex features (cookies, servers, etc.)

### Confirmation

We will check whether the website is properly deployed using Github Pages. This will include:
* Opening the website on multiple devices
* Testing if website behaves as expected
* Checking for team approval

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Github Pages

* Good, because it is free to use.
* Good, because it is easy to use with our Github repository.
* Good, because it supports all of the necessary features of our website.
* Neutral, because it produces a static web page.
* Bad, because it is not the best for more complex web application features (cookies, servers, etc.)

### Electron

* Good, because it enables us to create a cross-platform desktop app that is more professional and distributable.
* Bad, because has more complexity than required for the scope of this class.
