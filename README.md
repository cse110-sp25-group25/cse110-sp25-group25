# Food Flip (Team 25 | Quarter Life Crisis)
[Food Flip](https://cse110-sp25-group25.github.io/cse110-sp25-group25): A CSE 110 Project (Team 25)

## How is work done on the team? (For grading purposes, for TA)
- There are two teams: **Designers** and **Developers**
- During Sprint Planning meetings, tasks that are brainstormed by the team leads are distributed among **Designers** and **Developers**
  - Team leads keep track of the amount of work each team member has had (based on sizing/estimates of tasks) and assign tasks for the week accordingly
- Issues are created for each task with a description, user story, and estimates/sizing.
  - Issues are automatically populated into the backlog of the GitHub Projects board
- Throughout the sprint week, **Designers** and **Developers** meet virtually to discuss progress and work together, respectively
- As **Designers** and **Developers** complete tasks, pull requests are made, a message is sent into the `#pr-review` channel in Slack
- One review is needed to merge into main branch
- Sprint Review and Retrospective meetings are held at the end of sprint weeks
